# Keithley-IV-Scripts
Standalone Python control scripts for running IV Sweeps with one or two Keithley Sourcemeter 2400s

KeithleyIVSweep is used for voltage & current supply / readout from the same Keithley 2400 SMU  
KeithleyPVSweep is used for voltage supply from one Keithley 2400 SMU and current readout with a second Keithley 2400 SMU  
KeithleyPVSweep can be used for measuring optical coupling as a function of voltage by connecting a NIR photodetector to the current readout Keithley
